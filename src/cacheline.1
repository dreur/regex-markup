.TH CACHELINE "1" "May 4, 2005" "cacheline (regex-markup)"
.SH NAME
cacheline \- Delay newlines in output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cacheline
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page document describes the \fBcacheline\fP command.

The cacheline program reads from standard in and writes to standard
out. Whenever a newline character is read, it is inhibited and not
printed until another character is read. This way, when monitoring
files on a terminal (e.g. with tail), the bottom row (line) can be
used. (Normally this line is always empty due to the last newline
character printed.)
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
Monitor a syslog file:
.br
	\fBtail -f /var/log/syslog | cacheline\fB
.SH REPORTING BUGS
Report bugs to <\fIoskar@osk.mine.nu\fP>.
.SH AUTHOR
